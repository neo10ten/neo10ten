- 👋 Hi, I’m @neo10ten - I go by Michael in the real world.
- 👀 I’m hoping to reshape and sharpen my skillset so I can transition out of my current career into something new that affords me more flexibility with my time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript. Looking to develop into a full stack engineer but I've only recently started on my coding journey.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me learn more. Preferably in JavaScript so I can stick to one path as I get the hang of it for now.
- 📫 How to reach me email - michael.neophytou92@gmail.com - LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelneo/
